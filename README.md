# Masque-PL
A sandboxed, dynamically typed scripting language that runs embedded in Java. Being created for my upcoming Minecraft mod!

Huge, *huge* thanks to Robert Nystrom, the creator of [Crafting Interpreters](https://craftinginterpreters.com/). Without that resource, this language would never have been made.
